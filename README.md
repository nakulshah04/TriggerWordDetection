# Trigger_Word_Detection
Constructing an audio dataset (using synthesis) and implementing an algorithm for trigger detection

This is a personal project from DeepLearning.AI's [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/) Course#5: Sequence Models. There's essentially two steps:
- Synthesizing audio
- Training a model to recognize trigger words in audio
